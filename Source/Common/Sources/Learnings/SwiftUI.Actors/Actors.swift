 __Actors are a new reference type that protects its mutable state by ensuring that only one task can access that state at a time__.

 ----

  __Actors vs Classes__
 â€¢ Classes: Allow concurrent access to their properties and methods, which can lead to data races unless you manually synchronize access (e.g., using locks).
 â€¢ Actors: Automatically serialize access to their state, preventing data races by design.

     __Global Actors__

     Sometimes, you need a shared actor that can be used across different parts of your app: __global actors__. A global actor is a singleton actor that provides a single
     point of serialization for a particular part of your code.

     For example, the __@MainActor__ global actor ensures that certain operations are always performed on the main thread, which is crucial for updating the UI:

     */

    @MainActor
    func updateUI() {
        // Code that updates the UI
    }

    /// In addition to the built-in @MainActor, you can create custom global actors to control the execution context of certain parts of your app.
    @globalActor
    enum MyGlobalActor {
        /// In this example, __MyGlobalActor__ is a custom global actor. It encapsulates its own actor type (__ActorType__),
        /// which is used to provide the shared instance for concurrency management.
        actor ActorType {}
        static let shared = ActorType()
    }

    class GlobalActorUsage {
        @MyGlobalActor var sharedResource: [String] = []

        @MyGlobalActor
        func updateResource(with value: String) {
            sharedResource.append(value)
        }
    }
}
